# 🎵 Spotify Clone

A simple **Spotify web interface clone** built using **HTML** and **CSS**, replicating the look and feel of the Spotify landing page and music player UI.

This project focuses on frontend UI design and static layout recreation — making it a great learning project for practicing **HTML layouts**, **CSS styling**, and basic **responsive design**.

## 🧠 Getting Started

To view the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varun-kotagiri/Spotify-Clone.git
cd Spotify-Clone

📌 How It Works

This clone replicates the visual structure of Spotify’s web interface using:

HTML for semantic structure

CSS for layout, styles, fonts, colors, and positioning

Static images from the photos/ folder for icons and artwork

Note: It does not integrate with the Spotify API or support actual music playback.
